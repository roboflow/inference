# YOLOv11 - Classification

YOLOv11 is the latest iteration in the YOLO series developed by Ultralytics. The classification variant provides state-of-the-art performance for image classification tasks.

## Overview

YOLOv11 for classification represents the cutting edge of real-time image classification. Key features include:

- **Enhanced architecture** - Improved backbone design for better feature extraction
- **Superior accuracy** - Better performance than YOLOv8 on classification tasks
- **Fast inference** - Optimized for real-time applications
- **Efficient design** - Optimized for speed and accuracy
- **Multiple model sizes** - From nano to extra-large variants

## License

**AGPL-3.0**

!!! info "Commercial Licensing"
    - **AGPL-3.0**: Free for open-source projects. Requires derivative works to be open-sourced.
    - **Paid Roboflow customers**: Automatically get access to use any YOLOv11 models trained on or uploaded to the Roboflow platform for commercial use.
    - **Free Roboflow customers**: Can use YOLOv11 via the serverless hosted API, or commercially self-hosted with a paid plan.

## Pre-trained Model IDs

YOLOv11 classification models must be trained on Roboflow or uploaded as custom weights. There are no pre-trained public model IDs available.

**Custom model ID format:** `project-url/version` (e.g., `my-project-abc123/2`)

## Installation

Install with one of the following extras depending on your backend:

- **ONNX**: `onnx-cpu`, `onnx-cu12`
- **TensorRT**: `trt10` (requires CUDA 12.x)
- **TorchScript**: `torch-cpu`, `torch-cu118`, `torch-cu124`, `torch-cu126`, `torch-cu128`, `torch-jp6-cu126`

## Usage Example

```python
import cv2
from inference_models import AutoModel

# Load your custom model (requires Roboflow API key)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    "my-project-abc123/2",
    api_key="your_roboflow_api_key"
)
image = cv2.imread("path/to/image.jpg")

# Run inference
prediction = model(image)

# Get top prediction
top_class_id = prediction.class_id[0].item()
top_class = model.class_names[top_class_id]
confidence = prediction.confidence[0][top_class_id].item()

print(f"Class: {top_class}")
print(f"Confidence: {confidence:.2f}")
```
