Platform Model License 1.0 (PML-1.0)
Copyright (c) 2026 Roboflow, Inc

This license applies to the software, model weights, checkpoints, artifacts, and
associated documentation that are made available under this license (the “Software”).

1. Platform Plan Required

You may only use, reproduce, modify, or distribute the Software if you (and any entity
that you represent) have accepted and are complying with the terms (including pricing,
usage limits, and other usage metrics) of a separate platform plan, subscription, order
form, or other agreement with the Software’s provider that governs your access to and
use of the provider’s platform and/or models (collectively, the “Platform Agreement”).

2. Good Standing Requirement

If your account is terminated, suspended, or otherwise not in good standing under the
Platform Agreement (including, for example, non-payment on a paid plan or exceeding
usage limits on a free or paid plan), then you have no license to use the Software
unless and until your account returns to good standing, and you must immediately cease
all use of the Software. Upon request, you must certify in writing that all use has
ceased and all copies in your control (other than archival copies required by law) have
been deleted or disabled. Rights automatically reinstate upon return to good standing.

3. Modifications & Patches

You may modify the Software and publish patches to the Software. Any distribution of the
Software or any modified version of the Software must remain subject to, and in compliance
with, the Platform Agreement.

4. Usage Tracking and Reporting

The Software may include license checks, usage tracking, metering, telemetry, reporting,
watermarking, or other mechanisms to measure, report, or enforce plan entitlements,
pricing, or usage metrics (“Usage Tracking”).

You may not alter, bypass, disable, interfere with, or circumvent Usage Tracking, and you
may not remove or obscure any functionality that is protected by or used to enforce
entitlements, pricing, or plan limitations, except as expressly permitted by the provider
in writing.

If you use the Software in an environment, workflow, or deployment context that does not
include Usage Tracking, you are responsible for accurately tracking and reporting your
usage as required by the Platform Agreement and ensuring your usage remains within its
limits and terms.

5. No Reverse Engineering / No Extraction of Provider Base Weights

You may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the
Software or any portion of the Software, nor may you attempt to extract, reconstruct, or
otherwise obtain the provider’s pre-training checkpoint weights or parameters used to
create, train, initialize, distill, or fine-tune the Software (the “Base Weights”), except
to the extent such restriction is prohibited by applicable law.

6. Third-Party Components

For all third-party components incorporated into or required to use the Software,
those components are licensed under the original license provided by the owner of the
applicable component, and you must comply with those licenses in addition to this license.
In the event of a conflict between this license and an upstream license of a
third-party component included in the Software, the upstream license governs your use
of that component.

7. Required Notice

You must include the full text of this license with all copies or substantial portions
of the Software and retain all attribution, copyright, and license notices contained in
the Software. No rights to provider’s names, logos, or trademarks are granted, except to
the extent necessary to comply with this provision.

8. Export Compliance

You represent that you are not, and will not permit the Software to be used by, any party
or in any jurisdiction subject to trade or economic sanctions or export restrictions where
such use would be prohibited by applicable law.

9. Disclaimer

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE
FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER
DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

10. Miscellaneous

This license is governed by the laws specified in the Platform Agreement, and any disputes
will be resolved as provided therein. This license (together with the Platform Agreement)
is the entire agreement concerning the Software’s licensing. You may not assign this
license except as permitted under the Platform Agreement. If any provision is
unenforceable, it will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.
All rights not expressly granted are reserved. No implied licenses are granted.
