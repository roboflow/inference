  rationale: |
    The image shows a plastic jug placed side-up to pot plants.
    **Shape fidelity**: Fair - the reconstruction is a rectangular plastic jug placed side-up with some soil and plants in it, and is roughly correct.
    **Proportionality**: Fair - the reconstruction is slightly wider than the input.
    **Completeness**: Poor - the reconstruction has a clear missing part on the side, very clearly seen from the isometric view.
    **No artifact**: Good - mostly smooth with minimal artifacts.
    Overall: The reconstruction seems similar to the original object, but has distortions and missing parts.
    Score: 2

  rationale: |
    The image shows a plastic jug placed side-up to pot plants.
    **Shape fidelity**: Good - the reconstruction is a rectangular plastic jug placed side-up and is mostly correct.
    **Proportionality**: Good - the reconstruction is roughly the same shape and proportions as the input.
    **Completeness**: Good - the reconstruction shows the full plastic jug with no missing parts.
    **No artifact**: Good - no artifacts seen.
    Overall: The reconstruction seems pretty faithful to the original object, with no artifacts or missing parts.
    Score: 3

  rationale: |
    The image shows a plastic chair.
    **Shape fidelity**: Fair - the reconstruction depicts a plastic chair with a curved back and no armrest, but not exactly faithful to the input.
    **Proportionality**: Fair - the back seems different from the input (the input has long hollow parts on both left and right, but the reconstruction’s lower part appears solid).
    **Completeness**: Good - the reconstruction shows the full chair, with no missing parts.
    **No artifact**: Fair - there are artifacts near the leg bottoms.
    Overall: The reconstruction seems similar to the original object, but is not exactly faithful and has small artifacts.

  rationale: |
    The image shows a metal cart.
    **Shape fidelity**: Fair - the reconstruction depicts a metal cart with some objects on it. The input only masks out the cart but not the objects, so the reconstruction is not very accurate.  
    **Proportionality**: Poor - the input shows a rectangular cart, but the reconstruction appears square.  
    **Completeness**: Good - the reconstruction shows the cart with no missing parts.  
    **No artifact**: Fair - the surface shows extra objects smoothed into blobs.  
    Overall: The reconstruction seems distorted and includes extra objects.
    Score: 1
