LONG_DESCRIPTION = """
Create a branch of logic that runs only when a specified condition is met.

This block is the "if statement" in Workflows.

This block is responsible for flow-control in execution graph based on the condition 
defined in its body.

Right now, this block is only capable to make conditions based on output of binary 
operators that takes two operands. 

*The `Condition` block only works when a  single image is provided to the input of the 
`workflow` (or more precisely, both `left` and `right` if provided with reference, 
then the reference can only hold value for a result of operation made against single 
input). This is to prevent a situation when evaluation of condition for multiple 
images yield different execution paths.*
