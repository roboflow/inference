SHORT_DESCRIPTION: str = "Apply contrast equalization to an image."
LONG_DESCRIPTION = """
Enhance image contrast using configurable equalization methods (Contrast Stretching, Histogram Equalization, or Adaptive Equalization) to improve image visibility, distribute pixel intensities more evenly, and enhance details in low-contrast or poorly lit images for preprocessing, enhancement, and quality improvement workflows.

## How This Block Works

This block enhances image contrast by redistributing pixel intensities using one of three equalization methods. The block:

1. Receives an input image to enhance with contrast equalization
2. Selects the contrast equalization method based on equalization_type parameter
3. Applies the selected equalization method:

   **For Contrast Stretching:**
   - Calculates the 2nd and 98th percentiles of pixel intensities in the image (finds the darkest and brightest meaningful values, ignoring extreme outliers)
   - Stretches the intensity range between these percentiles to span the full 0-255 range
   - Enhances contrast by expanding the dynamic range while preserving relative intensity relationships
   - Useful for images with a narrow intensity range that need stretching to full range

   **For Histogram Equalization:**
   - Normalizes pixel intensities to 0-1 range for processing
   - Computes and equalizes the image histogram to create a uniform distribution of pixel intensities
   - Redistributes pixel values so that each intensity level has approximately equal frequency
   - Scales the equalized values back to 0-255 range
   - Enhances contrast globally across the entire image, improving visibility of features

   **For Adaptive Equalization:**
   - Normalizes pixel intensities to 0-1 range for processing
   - Applies adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE - Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
   - Divides the image into small regions and equalizes each region independently
   - Uses clip_limit=0.03 to limit contrast enhancement and prevent over-amplification of noise
   - Combines local equalized regions using bilinear interpolation for smooth transitions
   - Scales the result back to 0-255 range
   - Enhances contrast adaptively, preserving local details while improving overall visibility

4. Preserves image metadata from the original image
5. Returns the enhanced image with improved contrast

The block provides three methods with different characteristics: Contrast Stretching expands intensity ranges linearly, Histogram Equalization creates uniform intensity distribution globally, and Adaptive Equalization enhances contrast locally while preventing over-amplification. Each method works best for different scenarios - Contrast Stretching for images with narrow intensity ranges, Histogram Equalization for overall contrast improvement, and Adaptive Equalization for images with varying contrast across regions.

## Common Use Cases

- **Image Preprocessing for Models**: Enhance image contrast before feeding to detection or classification models (e.g., improve contrast before object detection, enhance visibility before classification, prepare images for model processing), enabling improved model performance workflows
- **Low-Contrast Image Enhancement**: Improve visibility and details in low-contrast or poorly lit images (e.g., enhance dark images, improve visibility in low-light conditions, reveal details in low-contrast scenes), enabling image enhancement workflows
- **Detail Enhancement**: Reveal hidden details in images with poor contrast (e.g., enhance details in shadow regions, reveal features in dark areas, improve visibility of subtle details), enabling detail enhancement workflows
- **Image Quality Improvement**: Improve overall image quality and visibility (e.g., enhance overall image quality, improve visibility for analysis, optimize images for display), enabling image quality workflows
- **Medical and Scientific Imaging**: Enhance contrast in medical or scientific images for better analysis (e.g., enhance medical imaging contrast, improve scientific image visibility, prepare images for analysis), enabling scientific imaging workflows
- **Document Image Enhancement**: Improve contrast in scanned documents or document images (e.g., enhance document contrast, improve text visibility, optimize scanned documents), enabling document enhancement workflows

## Connecting to Other Blocks

This block receives an image and produces an enhanced image with improved contrast:

- **After image input blocks** to enhance input images before further processing (e.g., enhance contrast in camera feeds, improve visibility in image inputs, optimize images for workflow processing), enabling image enhancement workflows
- **Before detection or classification models** to improve model performance with better contrast (e.g., enhance images before object detection, improve visibility for classification models, prepare images for model analysis), enabling enhanced model input workflows
- **After preprocessing blocks** to apply contrast enhancement after other preprocessing (e.g., enhance contrast after filtering, improve visibility after transformations, optimize images after preprocessing), enabling multi-stage enhancement workflows
- **Before visualization blocks** to display enhanced images with better visibility (e.g., visualize enhanced images, display improved contrast results, show enhancement effects), enabling enhanced visualization workflows
- **Before analysis blocks** that benefit from improved contrast (e.g., analyze enhanced images, process improved visibility images, work with optimized contrast), enabling enhanced analysis workflows
- **In image quality improvement pipelines** where contrast enhancement is part of a larger enhancement workflow (e.g., enhance images in multi-stage pipelines, improve quality through enhancement steps, optimize images in processing chains), enabling image quality pipeline workflows
