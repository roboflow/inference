LONG_DESCRIPTION = """
Retrieve a previously stored value from an in-memory cache by key, using the image's video identifier as a namespace to enable data sharing between workflow steps, caching intermediate results, and avoiding redundant computations within the same workflow execution context.

## How This Block Works

This block retrieves values from an in-memory cache that was previously stored using the Cache Set block. The block:

1. Receives image and cache key:
   - Takes an input image to determine the cache namespace
   - Receives a cache key (string) identifying which value to retrieve
2. Determines cache namespace:
   - Extracts video identifier from the image's video metadata
   - Uses the video identifier as the cache namespace (isolates cache entries per video/stream)
   - Falls back to "default" namespace if no video identifier is present
3. Looks up cached value:
   - Accesses the in-memory cache dictionary for the determined namespace
   - Searches for the specified key in the cache
   - Returns the cached value if found, or False if the key does not exist
4. Returns retrieved value:
   - Outputs the cached value (can be any data type: strings, numbers, lists, detections, etc.)
   - Returns False if the key was not found in the cache
   - The output type matches whatever was originally stored with Cache Set

The cache is namespaced by video identifier, meaning different videos or streams have separate cache storage. This allows workflows processing multiple videos to maintain separate caches for each video. The cache is stored in memory and is cleared when the workflow execution completes or when the block is destroyed. Cache Get must be used in conjunction with Cache Set - values are stored with Cache Set and retrieved with Cache Get using the same key and namespace (determined by the same video identifier).

## Common Use Cases

- **Shared State Between Steps**: Store intermediate results in one workflow step and retrieve them in another step (e.g., store detection results for later analysis, cache classification predictions for filtering, share metadata between blocks), enabling state sharing workflows
- **Avoid Redundant Computations**: Cache expensive computation results and reuse them across multiple workflow steps (e.g., cache model predictions, store processed images, reuse transformation results), enabling computation caching workflows
- **Video Frame Context**: Maintain context across video frames by storing frame-specific data (e.g., cache previous frame detections, store frame sequence metadata, maintain tracking state), enabling frame context workflows
- **Conditional Workflow Logic**: Store decision results or flags that control workflow execution in subsequent steps (e.g., cache filtering decisions, store validation results, maintain workflow state), enabling conditional execution workflows
- **Data Aggregation**: Accumulate data across workflow steps by storing values in cache and retrieving/updating them (e.g., aggregate detection counts, accumulate statistics, build result collections), enabling data aggregation workflows
- **Temporary Storage**: Use cache as temporary storage for values that need to be accessed by multiple workflow steps without passing through the workflow graph (e.g., store cross-step data, maintain temporary state, share non-linear workflow data), enabling temporary storage workflows

## Connecting to Other Blocks

This block retrieves cached values and can be used throughout workflows:

- **After Cache Set block** to retrieve values that were previously stored (e.g., retrieve stored detections, get cached predictions, access stored metadata), enabling cache retrieval workflows
- **In workflow branches** to access shared cache values from parallel or conditional execution paths (e.g., retrieve shared state, access cached results, get common data), enabling branch coordination workflows
- **Before blocks that need cached data** to provide cached values as input (e.g., provide cached detections to analysis, use cached predictions for filtering, pass cached metadata to processing), enabling cached input workflows
- **In conditional logic workflows** to retrieve flags or decisions stored by Cache Set (e.g., get cached validation results, retrieve decision flags, access conditional state), enabling conditional logic workflows
- **With video processing workflows** to maintain frame-specific or video-specific cache namespaces (e.g., retrieve frame context, access video-specific cache, get stream-specific data), enabling video context workflows
- **Before output or sink blocks** to include cached data in final results (e.g., include cached aggregations, output cached statistics, return cached results), enabling output workflows

## Requirements

This block requires an input image (used to determine the cache namespace via video identifier) and a cache key (string) to look up the stored value. The block only works in LOCAL execution mode - it will raise a NotImplementedError if used in other execution modes. Values must be previously stored using the Cache Set block with the same key and namespace (same video identifier). The cache is stored in memory and is automatically cleared when the workflow execution completes. The cache is namespaced by video identifier, so different videos have separate cache storage. If a key is not found in the cache, the block returns False. The cached value can be any data type (strings, numbers, lists, detections, images, etc.) depending on what was originally stored.
