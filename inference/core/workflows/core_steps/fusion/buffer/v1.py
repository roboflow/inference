Maintain a sliding window buffer of the last N values by storing recent inputs in a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue, with newest elements added to the beginning and oldest elements automatically removed when the buffer exceeds the specified length, enabling temporal data collection, frame history tracking, batch processing preparation, and sliding window analysis workflows.

## How This Block Works

This block maintains a rolling buffer that stores the most recent values passed to it, creating a sliding window of data over time. The block:

1. Receives input data of any type (images, detections, values, etc.) and configuration parameters (buffer length and padding option)
2. Maintains an internal buffer that persists across workflow executions:
   - Buffer is initialized as an empty list when the block is first created
   - Buffer state persists for the lifetime of the workflow execution
   - Each buffer block instance maintains its own separate buffer
3. Adds new data to the buffer:
   - Inserts the newest value at the beginning (index 0) of the buffer array
   - Most recent values appear first in the buffer
   - Older values are shifted to later positions in the array
4. Manages buffer size:
   - When buffer length exceeds the specified `length` parameter, removes the oldest elements
   - Keeps only the most recent `length` values
   - Automatically maintains the sliding window size
5. Applies optional padding:
   - If `pad` is True: Fills the buffer with `None` values until it reaches exactly `length` elements
   - Ensures consistent buffer size even when fewer than `length` values have been received
   - If `pad` is False: Buffer size grows from 0 to `length` as values are added, then stays at `length`
6. Returns the buffered array:
   - Outputs a list containing the buffered values in order (newest first)
   - List length equals `length` (if padding enabled) or current buffer size (if padding disabled)
   - Values are ordered from most recent (index 0) to oldest (last index)

The buffer implements a sliding window pattern where new data enters at the front and old data exits at the back when capacity is reached. This creates a temporal history of recent values, useful for operations that need to look back at previous frames, detections, or measurements. The buffer works with any data type, making it flexible for images, detections, numeric values, or other workflow outputs.

## Common Use Cases

- **Frame History Tracking**: Maintain a history of recent video frames for temporal analysis (e.g., track frame sequences, maintain recent image history, collect frames for comparison), enabling temporal frame analysis workflows
- **Detection History**: Buffer recent detections for trend analysis or comparison (e.g., track detection changes over time, compare current vs previous detections, analyze detection patterns), enabling detection history workflows
- **Batch Processing Preparation**: Collect multiple values before processing them together (e.g., batch process recent images, aggregate multiple detections, prepare data for batch operations), enabling batch processing workflows
- **Sliding Window Analysis**: Perform analysis on a rolling window of data (e.g., analyze trends over recent frames, calculate moving averages, detect changes in sequences), enabling sliding window analysis workflows
- **Visualization Sequences**: Maintain recent data for animation or sequence visualization (e.g., create frame sequences, visualize temporal changes, display recent history), enabling temporal visualization workflows
- **Temporal Comparison**: Compare current values with recent historical values (e.g., compare current frame with previous frames, detect changes over time, analyze temporal patterns), enabling temporal comparison workflows

## Connecting to Other Blocks

This block receives data of any type and produces a buffered output array:

- **After any block** that produces values to buffer (e.g., buffer images from image sources, buffer detections from detection models, buffer values from analytics blocks), enabling data buffering workflows
- **Before blocks that process arrays** to provide batched or historical data (e.g., process buffered images, analyze detection arrays, work with value sequences), enabling array processing workflows
- **Before visualization blocks** to display sequences or temporal data (e.g., visualize frame sequences, display detection history, show temporal patterns), enabling temporal visualization workflows
- **Before analysis blocks** that require historical data (e.g., analyze trends over time, compare current vs historical, process temporal sequences), enabling temporal analysis workflows
- **Before aggregation blocks** to provide multiple values for aggregation (e.g., aggregate buffered values, process multiple detections, combine recent data), enabling aggregation workflows
- **In temporal processing pipelines** where maintaining recent history is required (e.g., track changes over time, maintain frame sequences, collect data for temporal analysis), enabling temporal processing workflows

## Requirements

This block works with any data type (images, detections, values, etc.). The buffer maintains state across workflow executions within the same workflow instance. The `length` parameter determines the maximum number of values to keep in the buffer. When `pad` is enabled, the buffer will always return exactly `length` elements (padded with `None` if needed). When `pad` is disabled, the buffer grows from 0 to `length` elements as values are added, then maintains `length` elements by removing oldest values. The buffer persists for the lifetime of the workflow execution and resets when the workflow is restarted.
