This block merges detections that were inferred for multiple sub-parts of the same input image
into single detection. 

Block may be helpful in the following scenarios:
* to apply [Slicing Adaptive Inference (SAHI)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9897990) technique, 
as a final step of procedure, which involves Image Slicer block and model block at previous stages.
* to merge together detections performed by precise, high-resolution model applied as secondary
model after coarse detection is performed in the first stage and Dynamic Crop is applied later.
