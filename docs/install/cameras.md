# Camera Setup

You can run computer vision Workflows developed with Inference on images and videos.

Out of the box, Inference has support for:

- Built-in device cameras
- USB cameras
- RTSP streams

All of the above devices require no additional configuration.

## Industrial Cameras

You can also run Inference on video streams from industrial cameras. The industrial cameras listed below are supported. Choose a camera to read the installation instructions.

- Basler
- Lucid
- FLIR

To learn how to set up these cameras with Inference, contact your Roboflow enterprise representative, or [contact the Roboflow sales team](https://roboflow.com/sales).

## PTZ Cameras

You can use PTZ cameras with Inference, and control their position using the results from detection models running in a Workflow.

To learn how to control a PTZ camera with Inference and Workflows, refer to our [Workflows PTZ camera guide](https://blog.roboflow.com/control-ptz-camera-computer-vision/).
