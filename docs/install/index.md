# Local Installation using Docker

Inference is built to be run at the edge. It loads and executes model
weights and does computation locally. It can run fully offline (once
model weights are downloaded) but it's often useful to maintain a
network connection for interfacing with outside systems (like PLCs on
the local network, or remote systems for storing data and sending
notifications).

## Run via Docker

The preferred way to use Inference is via Docker
(see [Why Docker](/understand/architecture.md#why-docker)).

[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (and
[NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
for GPU acceleration if you have a CUDA-enabled GPU). Then run:

```bash
pip install inference-cli
inference server start
```

The `inference server start` command attempts to automatically choose
and configure the optimal container to optimize performance on your machine.
See [Using Your New Server](#using-your-new-server) for next steps.

!!! Tip
    Special installation notes and performance tips by device are also available.
    Browse the navigation on the left for detailed install guides.

## Dev Mode

The `--dev` parameter to `inference server start` starts in development mode.
This spins up a companion Jupyter notebook server with a quickstart guide on
[`localhost:9002`](http://localhost:9002). Dive in there for a whirlwind tour
of your new Inference Server's functionality!

```bash
inference server start --dev
```
