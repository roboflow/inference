## Roboflow Inference

[Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) Inference is an opinionated tool for running inference on state-of-the-art computer vision models. With no prior
knowledge of machine learning or device-specific deployment, you can deploy a computer vision model to a range of devices and environments. Inference supports object detection, classification, and instance segmentation models, and running foundation models (CLIP and SAM).

## üë©‚Äçüè´ Examples

The [`/examples` directory](./examples/) contains example code for working with and extending `inference`, including HTTP and UDP client code and an insights dashboard, along with community examples (PRs welcome)!

## üíª Why Inference?

Inference provides a scalable method through which you can manage inferences for your vision projects.

Inference is backed by:

- A server, so you don‚Äôt have to reimplement things like image processing and prediction visualization on every project.

- Standardized APIs for computer vision tasks, so switching out the model weights and architecture can be done independently of your application code.

- Model architecture implementations, which implement the tensor parsing glue between images and predictions for supervised models that you've fine-tuned to perform custom tasks.

- A model registry, so your code can be independent from your model weights & you don't have to re-build and re-deploy every time you want to iterate on your model weights.

- Data management integrations, so you can collect more images of edge cases to improve your dataset & model the more it sees in the wild.

And more!

### üìå Install pip vs Docker:

- **pip**: Installs `inference` into your Python environment. Lightweight, good for Python-centric projects.
- **Docker**: Packages `inference` with its environment. Ensures consistency across setups; ideal for scalable deployments.

## üíª install

### With ONNX CPU Runtime:

For CPU powered inference:

```bash
pip install inference
```

or

```bash
pip install inference-cpu
```

### With ONNX GPU Runtime:

If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you can accelerate your inference with:

```bash
pip install inference-gpu
```

### Without ONNX Runtime:

Roboflow Inference uses Onnxruntime as its core inference engine. Onnxruntime provides an array of different [execution providers](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/) that can optimize inference on differnt target devices. If you decide to install onnxruntime on your own, install inference with:

```bash
pip install inference-core
```

Alternatively, you can take advantage of some advanced execution providers using one of our published docker images.

### Extras:

Some functionality requires extra dependencies. These can be installed by specifying the desired extras during installation of Roboflow Inference.
| extra | description |
|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| `clip` | Ability to use the core `CLIP` model (by OpenAI) |
| `gaze` | Ability to use the core `Gaze` model |
| `http` | Ability to run the http interface |
| `sam`  | Ability to run the core `Segment Anything` model (by Meta AI) |

**_Note:_** Both CLIP and Segment Anything require pytorch to run. These are included in their respective dependencies however pytorch installs can be highly environment dependent. See the [official pytorch install page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for instructions specific to your enviornment.

Example install with http dependencies:

```bash
pip install inference[http]
```

## üìü CLI

To use the CLI you will need python 3.7 or higher. To ensure you have the correct version of python, run `python --version` in your terminal. To install python, follow the instructions [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

After you have python installed, install the pypi package `inference-cli` or `inference`:

```bash
pip install inference-cli
```

From there you can run the inference server. See [Docker quickstart via CLI](./quickstart/docker.md/#via-cli) for more information.

```bash
inference server start
```

To use the CLI to make inferences, first find your project ID and model version number in the Roboflow documentation, [Workspace and Project IDs](https://docs.roboflow.com/api-reference/workspace-and-project-ids).

See more detailed documentation on [HTTP Inference quickstart via CLI](./quickstart/http_inference.md/#via-cli).

```bash
inference infer {image_path} \
    --project-id {project_id} \
    --model-version {model_version} \
    --api-key {api_key}
```

## üî• quickstart

**Docker Quickstart**:

```python
import requests

dataset_id = "soccer-players-5fuqs"
version_id = "1"
image_url = "https://source.roboflow.com/pwYAXv9BTpqLyFfgQoPZ/u48G0UpWfk8giSw7wrU8/original.jpg"
#Replace ROBOFLOW_API_KEY with your Roboflow API Key
api_key = "ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
confidence = 0.5

url = f"http://localhost:9001/{dataset_id}/{version_id}"

params = {
    "api_key": api_key,
    "confidence": confidence,
    "image": image_url,
}

res = requests.post(url, params=params)
print(res.json())
```

**pip Quickstart**:

After installing via pip, you can run a simple inference using:

```python
from inference.models.utils import get_roboflow_model

model = get_roboflow_model(
    model_id="soccer-players-5fuqs/1", 
    #Replace ROBOFLOW_API_KEY with your Roboflow API Key
    api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
)

results = model.infer(image="https://source.roboflow.com/pwYAXv9BTpqLyFfgQoPZ/u48G0UpWfk8giSw7wrU8/original.jpg", confidence=0.5, iou_threshold=0.5)

print(results)

```

**CLIP Quickstart**:

You can run inference with OpenAI's CLIP model using:

```python
from inference.models import Clip

model = Clip(
    #Replace ROBOFLOW_API_KEY with your Roboflow API Key
    api_key = "ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
)

image_url = "https://source.roboflow.com/7fLqS2r1SV8mm0YzyI0c/yy6hjtPUFFkq4yAvhkvs/original.jpg"

embeddings = model.embed_image(image_url)

print(embeddings)
```

**SAM Quickstart**:

You can run inference with Meta's Segment Anything model using:

```python
from inference.models import SegmentAnything

model = SegmentAnything(
    #Replace ROBOFLOW_API_KEY with your Roboflow API Key
    api_key = "ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
)

image_url = "https://source.roboflow.com/7fLqS2r1SV8mm0YzyI0c/yy6hjtPUFFkq4yAvhkvs/original.jpg"

embeddings = model.embed_image(image_url)

print(embeddings)
```

## üèóÔ∏è inference process

To standardize the inference process throughout all our models, Roboflow Inference has a structure for processing inference requests. The specifics can be found on each model's respective page, but overall it works like this for most models:
