# Inference Client

The `InferenceHTTPClient` enables you to interact with Inference over HTTP.

You can use this client to run models hosted:

1. On the Roboflow platform (use client version `v0`), and;
2. On device with Inference.

For models trained on the Roboflow platform, client accepts the following inputs:

- A single image (Given as a local path, URL, `np.ndarray` or `PIL.Image`);
- Multiple images;
- A directory of images, or;
- A video file.
- Single image encoded as `base64`

For core model - client exposes dedicated methods to be used, but standard image loader used accepts
file paths, URLs, `np.ndarray` and `PIL.Image` formats. Apart from client version (`v0` or `v1`) - options
provided via configuration are used against models trained at the platform, not the core models.

The client returns a dictionary of predictions for each image or frame.

Starting from `0.9.10` - `InferenceHTTPClient` provides async equivalents for the majority of methods and
support for requests parallelism and batching implemented (yet in limited scope, not for all methods). 
Further details to be found in specific sections of this document. 

!!! tip

    Read our [Run Model on an Image](../quickstart/run_model_on_image.md) guide to learn how to run a model with the Inference Client.

## Quickstart

```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient

CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
    api_url="http://localhost:9001",
    api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
)

image_url = "https://source.roboflow.com/pwYAXv9BTpqLyFfgQoPZ/u48G0UpWfk8giSw7wrU8/original.jpg"
result = CLIENT.infer(image_url, model_id="soccer-players-5fuqs/1")
```

### AsyncIO client
```python
import asyncio
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient

CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
    api_url="http://localhost:9001",
    api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
)

image_url = "https://source.roboflow.com/pwYAXv9BTpqLyFfgQoPZ/u48G0UpWfk8giSw7wrU8/original.jpg"
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
result = loop.run_until_complete(
  CLIENT.infer_async(image_url, model_id="soccer-players-5fuqs/1")
)
```

## Configuration options (used for models trained on the Roboflow platform)

### configuring with context managers

Methods `use_configuration(...)`, `use_api_v0(...)`, `use_api_v1(...)`, `use_model(...)` are designed to
work in context managers. **Once context manager is left - old config values are restored.**

```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient, InferenceConfiguration

image_url = "https://source.roboflow.com/pwYAXv9BTpqLyFfgQoPZ/u48G0UpWfk8giSw7wrU8/original.jpg"

custom_configuration = InferenceConfiguration(confidence_threshold=0.8)
# Replace ROBOFLOW_API_KEY with your Roboflow API Key
CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
    api_url="http://localhost:9001",
    api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
)
with CLIENT.use_api_v0():
    _ = CLIENT.infer(image_url, model_id="soccer-players-5fuqs/1")

with CLIENT.use_configuration(custom_configuration):
    _ = CLIENT.infer(image_url, model_id="soccer-players-5fuqs/1")

with CLIENT.use_model("soccer-players-5fuqs/1"):
    _ = CLIENT.infer(image_url)

# after leaving context manager - changes are reverted and `model_id` is still required
_ = CLIENT.infer(image_url, model_id="soccer-players-5fuqs/1")
```

As you can see - `model_id` is required to be given for prediction method only when default model is not configured.
{% include 'model_id.md' %}

### Setting the configuration once and using till next change

Methods `configure(...)`, `select_api_v0(...)`, `select_api_v1(...)`, `select_model(...)` are designed alter the client
state and will be preserved until next change.

```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient, InferenceConfiguration

image_url = "https://source.roboflow.com/pwYAXv9BTpqLyFfgQoPZ/u48G0UpWfk8giSw7wrU8/original.jpg"

custom_configuration = InferenceConfiguration(confidence_threshold=0.8)
# Replace ROBOFLOW_API_KEY with your Roboflow API Key
CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
    api_url="http://localhost:9001",
    api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
)
CLIENT.select_api_v0()
_ = CLIENT.infer(image_url, model_id="soccer-players-5fuqs/1")

# API v0 still holds
CLIENT.configure(custom_configuration)
CLIENT.infer(image_url, model_id="soccer-players-5fuqs/1")

# API v0 and custom configuration still holds
CLIENT.select_model(model_id="soccer-players-5fuqs/1")
_ = CLIENT.infer(image_url)

# API v0, custom configuration and selected model - still holds
_ = CLIENT.infer(image_url)
```

One may also initialise in `chain` mode:

```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient, InferenceConfiguration

# Replace ROBOFLOW_API_KEY with your Roboflow API Key
CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(api_url="http://localhost:9001", api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY") \
    .select_api_v0() \
    .select_model("soccer-players-5fuqs/1")
```

### Overriding `model_id` for specific call

`model_id` can be overriden for specific call

```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient

image_url = "https://source.roboflow.com/pwYAXv9BTpqLyFfgQoPZ/u48G0UpWfk8giSw7wrU8/original.jpg"

# Replace ROBOFLOW_API_KEY with your Roboflow API Key
CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(api_url="http://localhost:9001", api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY") \
    .select_model("soccer-players-5fuqs/1")

_ = CLIENT.infer(image_url, model_id="another-model/1")
```

## Parallel / Batch inference

You may want to predict against multiple images at single call. There are two parameters of `InferenceConfiguration`
that specifies batching and parallelism options:
- `max_concurrent_requests` - max number of concurrent requests that can be started 
- `max_batch_size` - max number of elements that can be injected into single request (in `v0` mode - API only 
support a single image in payload for the majority of endpoints - hence in this case, value will be overriden with `1`
to prevent errors)

Thanks to that the following improvements can be achieved:
- if you run inference container with API on prem on powerful GPU machine - setting `max_batch_size` properly
may bring performance / throughput benefits
- if you run inference against hosted Roboflow API - setting `max_concurrent_requests` will cause multiple images
being served at once bringing performance / throughput benefits
- combination of both options can be beneficial for clients running inference container with API on cluster of machines,
then the load of single node can be optimised and parallel requests to different nodes can be made at a time 
``

```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient

image_url = "https://source.roboflow.com/pwYAXv9BTpqLyFfgQoPZ/u48G0UpWfk8giSw7wrU8/original.jpg"

# Replace ROBOFLOW_API_KEY with your Roboflow API Key
CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
    api_url="http://localhost:9001",
    api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
)
predictions = CLIENT.infer([image_url] * 5, model_id="soccer-players-5fuqs/1")

print(predictions)
```

Methods that support batching / parallelism:
-`infer(...)` and `infer_async(...)`
- `infer_from_api_v0(...)` and `infer_from_api_v0_async(...)` (enforcing `max_batch_size=1`)
- `ocr_image(...)` and `ocr_image_async(...)` (enforcing `max_batch_size=1`)
- `detect_gazes(...)` and `detect_gazes_async(...)`
- `get_clip_image_embeddings(...)` and `get_clip_image_embeddings_async(...)`


## Client for core models

`InferenceHTTPClient` now supports core models hosted via `inference`. Part of the models can be used on the Roboflow 
hosted inference platform (use `https://infer.roboflow.com` as url), other are possible to be deployed locally (usually
local server will be available under `http://localhost:9001`).

!!! tip

    Install `inference-cli` package to easily run `inference` API locally
    ```bash
    pip install inference-cli
    inference server start
    ```

### Clip

```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient

CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
    api_url="http://localhost:9001",  # or "https://infer.roboflow.com" to use hosted serving
    api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
)

CLIENT.get_clip_image_embeddings(inference_input="./my_image.jpg")  # single image request
CLIENT.get_clip_image_embeddings(inference_input=["./my_image.jpg", "./other_image.jpg"])  # batch image request
CLIENT.get_clip_text_embeddings(text="some")  # single text request
CLIENT.get_clip_text_embeddings(text=["some", "other"])  # other text request
CLIENT.clip_compare(
    subject="./my_image.jpg",
    prompt=["fox", "dog"],
)
```

`CLIENT.clip_compare(...)` method allows to compare different combination of `subject_type` and `prompt_type`:

- `(image, image)`
- `(image, text)`
- `(text, image)`
- `(text, text)`
  Default mode is `(image, text)`.

!!! tip

    ```python
    from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient
    
    CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
        api_url="http://localhost:9001",  # or "https://infer.roboflow.com" to use hosted serving
        api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
    )
    
    async def see_async_method(): 
      await CLIENT.get_clip_image_embeddings_async(inference_input="./my_image.jpg")  # single image request
      await CLIENT.get_clip_image_embeddings_async(inference_input=["./my_image.jpg", "./other_image.jpg"])  # batch image request
      await CLIENT.get_clip_text_embeddings_async(text="some")  # single text request
      await CLIENT.get_clip_text_embeddings_async(text=["some", "other"])  # other text request
      await CLIENT.clip_compare_async(
          subject="./my_image.jpg",
          prompt=["fox", "dog"],
      )
    ```

### CogVLM - *DEPRECATED in `inference 0.38.0`*


!!! warning "Method deprecated"

    CogVLM was deprecated in `inference 0.38.0` due to changes we need to apply to mitigate 
    [CVE-2024-11393](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-11393).

```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient

CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
    api_url="http://localhost:9001",  # only local hosting supported
    api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
)

CLIENT.prompt_cogvlm(
    visual_prompt="./my_image.jpg",
    text_prompt="So - what is your final judgement about the content of the picture?",
    chat_history=[("I think the image shows XXX", "You are wrong - the image shows YYY")], # optional parameter
)
```

### DocTR

```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient

CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
    api_url="http://localhost:9001",  # or "https://infer.roboflow.com" to use hosted serving
    api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
)

CLIENT.ocr_image(inference_input="./my_image.jpg")  # single image request
CLIENT.ocr_image(inference_input=["./my_image.jpg", "./other_image.jpg"])  # batch image request
```

!!! tip

    Check out async methods for DocTR model:

    CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
        api_url="http://localhost:9001",  # or "https://infer.roboflow.com" to use hosted serving
        api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
    )
    
    async def see_async_method(): 
      await CLIENT.ocr_image(inference_input="./my_image.jpg")  # single image request
    ```

### Gaze

```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient

CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
    api_url="http://localhost:9001",  # only local hosting supported
    api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
)

CLIENT.detect_gazes(inference_input="./my_image.jpg")  # single image request
CLIENT.detect_gazes(inference_input=["./my_image.jpg", "./other_image.jpg"])  # batch image request
```

!!! tip

    Check out async methods for Gaze model:
    ```python
    from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient
    
    CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
        api_url="http://localhost:9001",  # or "https://infer.roboflow.com" to use hosted serving
        api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
    )
    
    async def see_async_method(): 
      await CLIENT.detect_gazes(inference_input="./my_image.jpg")  # single image request
    ```


## Inference against stream

One may want to infer against video or directory of images - and that modes are supported in `inference-client`

```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient

# Replace ROBOFLOW_API_KEY with your Roboflow API Key
CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
    api_url="http://localhost:9001",
    api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
)
for frame_id, frame, prediction in CLIENT.infer_on_stream("video.mp4", model_id="soccer-players-5fuqs/1"):
    # frame_id is the number of frame
    # frame - np.ndarray with video frame
    # prediction - prediction from the model
    pass

for file_path, image, prediction in CLIENT.infer_on_stream("local/dir/", model_id="soccer-players-5fuqs/1"):
    # file_path - path to the image
    # frame - np.ndarray with video frame
    # prediction - prediction from the model
    pass
```

## What is actually returned as prediction?

`inference_client` returns plain Python dictionaries that are responses from model serving API. Modification
is done only in context of `visualization` key that keep server-generated prediction visualisation (it
can be transcoded to the format of choice) and in terms of client-side re-scaling.

## Methods to control `inference` server (in `v1` mode only)

### Getting server info

```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient

# Replace ROBOFLOW_API_KEY with your Roboflow API Key
CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
    api_url="http://localhost:9001",
    api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
)
CLIENT.get_server_info()
```

### Listing loaded models

```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient

# Replace ROBOFLOW_API_KEY with your Roboflow API Key
CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
    api_url="http://localhost:9001",
    api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
)
CLIENT.list_loaded_models()
```

!!! tip

    This method has async equivaluent: `list_loaded_models_async()`


### Getting specific model description

```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient

# Replace ROBOFLOW_API_KEY with your Roboflow API Key
CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
    api_url="http://localhost:9001",
    api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
)
CLIENT.get_model_description(model_id="some/1", allow_loading=True)
```

If `allow_loading` is set to `True`: model will be loaded as side-effect if it is not already loaded.
Default: `True`.

!!! tip

    This method has async equivaluent: `get_model_description_async()`

### Loading model

```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient

# Replace ROBOFLOW_API_KEY with your Roboflow API Key
CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
    api_url="http://localhost:9001",
    api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
)
CLIENT.load_model(model_id="some/1", set_as_default=True)
```

The pointed model will be loaded. If `set_as_default` is set to `True`: after successful load, model
will be used as default model for the client. Default value: `False`.

!!! tip

    This method has async equivaluent: `load_model_async()`

### Unloading model

```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient

# Replace ROBOFLOW_API_KEY with your Roboflow API Key
CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
    api_url="http://localhost:9001",
    api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
)
CLIENT.unload_model(model_id="some/1")
```

Sometimes (to avoid OOM at server side) - unloading model will be required.


!!! tip

    This method has async equivaluent: `unload_model_async()`

### Unloading all models

```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient

# Replace ROBOFLOW_API_KEY with your Roboflow API Key
CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
    api_url="http://localhost:9001",
    api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
)
CLIENT.unload_all_models()
```

!!! tip

    This method has async equivaluent: `unload_all_models_async()`


## Inference `workflows`

!!! tip

    This feature is in `alpha` preview. We encourage you to experiment and reach out to us with issues spotted.
    Check out [documentation of deployment specs, create one and run](https://github.com/roboflow/inference/tree/main/inference/enterprise/workflows)

!!! tip

    This feature only works with locally hosted inference container and hosted platform (access may be limited). 
    Use inefernce-cli to run local container with HTTP API:
    ```
    inference server start
    ```

!!! warning
  
    Method `infer_from_workflow(...)` is deprecated starting from `v0.9.21` and 
    will be removed end of Q2 2024. Please migrate - the signature is the same, 
    what changes is underlying inference server endpoint used to run workflow.
    
    New method is called `run_workflow(...)` and is compatible with Roboflow hosted
    API and inverence servers in versions `0.9.21+` 

```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient

# Replace ROBOFLOW_API_KEY with your Roboflow API Key
CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
    api_url="http://localhost:9001",
    api_key="ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
)

# for older versions of server than v0.9.21 use: CLIENT.infer_from_workflow(...) 
CLIENT.run_workflow(
    specification={
        "version": "1.0",
        "inputs": [
            {"type": "InferenceImage", "name": "image"},
            {"type": "InferenceParameter", "name": "my_param"},
        ],
        # ...
    },
    # OR
    # workspace_name="my_workspace_name",
    # workflow_id="my_workflow_id",

    images={
        "image": "url or your np.array",
    },
    parameters={
        "my_param": 37,
    },
)
```

Please note that either `specification` is provided with specification of workflow as described
[here](../workflows/definitions.md) or 
both `workspace_name` and `workflow_id` are given to use workflow predefined in Roboflow app. `workspace_name`
can be found in Roboflow APP URL once browser shows the main panel of workspace.

!!! warning "Server-side caching of Workflow definitions"

    In `inference v0.22.0` we've added server-side caching of Workflows reginsted on Roboflow platform which is
    **enabled by default**. When you use `run_workflow(...)` method with `workspace_name` and `workflow_id`
    server will cache the definition for 15 minutes. If you change the definition in Workflows UI and re-run the
    method, you may not see the change. To force processing without cache, pass `use_cache=False` as a parameter of 
    `run_workflow(...)` method. 


!!! tip "Workflows profiling"

    Since `inference v0.22.0`, you may request profiler trace of your Workflow execution from server passing 
    `enable_profiling=True` parameter to `run_workflow(...)` method. If server configuration enables traces exposure,
    you will be able to find a JSON file with trace in a directory specified by `profiling_directory` parameter of 
    `InferenceConfiguration` - by default it is `inference_profiling` directory in your current working directory.
    The traces can be directly loaded and rendered in Google Chrome - navigate into `chrome://tracing` in your 
    borwser and hit "load" button. 
    

## Details about client configuration

`inference-client` provides `InferenceConfiguration` dataclass to hold whole configuration.

```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceConfiguration
```

Overriding fields in this config changes the behaviour of client (and API serving model). Specific fields are
used in specific contexts. In particular:

### Inference in `v0` mode

The following fields are passed to API

- `confidence_threshold` (as `confidence`) - to alter model thresholding
- `keypoint_confidence_threshold` as (`keypoint_confidence`) - to filter out detected keypoints
  based on model confidence
- `format`: to visualise on server side - use `image` (just the image) or `image_and_json` (prediction details and image base64)
- `visualize_labels` (as `labels`) - used in visualisation to show / hide labels for classes
- `mask_decode_mode`
- `tradeoff_factor`
- `max_detections`: max detections to return from model
- `iou_threshold` (as `overlap`) - to dictate NMS IoU threshold
- `stroke_width`: width of stroke in visualisation
- `count_inference` as `countinference`
- `service_secret`
- `disable_preproc_auto_orientation`, `disable_preproc_contrast`, `disable_preproc_grayscale`,
  `disable_preproc_static_crop` to alter server-side pre-processing
- `disable_active_learning` to prevent Active Learning feature from registering the datapoint (can be useful for
  instance while testing model)
- `source` Optional string to set a "source" attribute on the inference call; if using model monitoring, this will get logged with the inference request so you can filter/query inference requests coming from a particular source. e.g. to identify which application, system, or deployment is making the request.

- `active_learning_target_dataset` - making inference from specific model (let's say `project_a/1`), when we want
to save data in another project `project_b` - the latter should be pointed to by this parameter. **Please remember that
you cannot use different type of models in `project_a` and `project_b` - if that is the case - data will not be 
registered) - since `v0.9.18`

you cannot use different type of models in `project_a` and `project_b` - if that is the case - data will not be 
registered) - since `v0.9.18`

### Instance segmentation model in `v1` mode:

- `visualize_predictions`: flag to enable / disable visualisation
- `visualize_labels`: flag to enable / disable labels visualisation if visualisation is enabled
- `confidence_threshold` as `confidence`
- `class_filter` to filter out list of classes
- `class_agnostic_nms`: flag to control whether NMS is class-agnostic
- `fix_batch_size`
- `iou_threshold`: to dictate NMS IoU threshold
- `stroke_width`: width of stroke in visualisation
- `max_detections`: max detections to return from model
- `max_candidates`: max candidates to post-processing from model
- `disable_preproc_auto_orientation`, `disable_preproc_contrast`, `disable_preproc_grayscale`,
  `disable_preproc_static_crop` to alter server-side pre-processing
- `mask_decode_mode`
- `tradeoff_factor`
- `disable_active_learning` to prevent Active Learning feature from registering the datapoint (can be useful for
  instance while testing model)
- `source` Optional string to set a "source" attribute on the inference call; if using model monitoring, this will get logged with the inference request so you can filter/query inference requests coming from a particular source. e.g. to identify which application, system, or deployment is making the request.
- `source_info` Optional string to set additional "source_info" attribute on the inference call; e.g. to identify a sub component in an app.
- `active_learning_target_dataset` - making inference from specific model (let's say `project_a/1`), when we want
to save data in another project `project_b` - the latter should be pointed to by this parameter. **Please remember that
you cannot use different type of models in `project_a` and `project_b` - if that is the case - data will not be 
registered) - since `v0.9.18`

### Configuration of client
- `output_visualisation_format`: one of (`VisualisationResponseFormat.BASE64`, `VisualisationResponseFormat.NUMPY`,
  `VisualisationResponseFormat.PILLOW`) - given that server-side visualisation is enabled - one may choose what
  format should be used in output
- `image_extensions_for_directory_scan`: while using `CLIENT.infer_on_stream(...)` with local directory
  this parameter controls type of files (extensions) allowed to be processed -
  default: `["jpg", "jpeg", "JPG", "JPEG", "png", "PNG"]`
- `client_downsizing_disabled`: set to `False` if you want to perform client-side downsizing - default `True` (
  changed in version `0.16.0` - previously was `False`).
  Client-side scaling is only supposed to down-scale (keeping aspect-ratio) the input for inference -
  to utilise internet connection more efficiently (but for the price of images manipulation / transcoding).
  If model registry endpoint is available (mode `v1`) - model input size information will be used, if not:
  `default_max_input_size` will be in use.
- `max_concurrent_requests` - max number of concurrent requests that can be started 
- `max_batch_size` - max number of elements that can be injected into single request (in `v0` mode - API only 
support a single image in payload for the majority of endpoints - hence in this case, value will be overriden with `1`
to prevent errors)

!!! warning

    The default value for flag `client_downsizing_disabled` was changed from `False` to `True` in release `0.16.0`!
    For clients using models with input size above `1024x1024` running models on hosted 
    platform it should improve predictions quality (as previous default behaviour was causing that input was downsized 
    and then artificially upsized on the server side with worse image quality). 
    There may be some clients that would like to remain previous settings to potentially improve speed (
    when internet connection is a bottleneck and large images are submitted despite small 
    model input size). 

### Configuration of Workflows execution

- `profiling_directory`: parameter specify the location where Workflows profiler traces are saved. By default, it is
`./inference_profiling` directory.

## FAQs

## Why does the Inference client have two modes (`v0` and `v1`)?

We are constantly improving our `infrence` package - initial version (`v0`) is compatible with
models deployed on the Roboflow platform (task types: `classification`, `object-detection`, `instance-segmentation` and
`keypoints-detection`)
are supported. Version `v1` is available in locally hosted Docker images with HTTP API.

Locally hosted `inference` server exposes endpoints for model manipulations, but those endpoints are not available
at the moment for models deployed on the Roboflow platform.

`api_url` parameter passed to `InferenceHTTPClient` will decide on default client mode - URLs with `*.roboflow.com`
will be defaulted to version `v0`.

Usage of model registry control methods with `v0` clients will raise `WrongClientModeError`.
