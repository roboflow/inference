# Bundling Workflows blocks

To efficiently manage the Workflows ecosystem, a standardized method for building and distributing blocks is 
essential. This allows users to create their own blocks and bundle them into Workflow plugins. A Workflow plugin 
is essentially a Python library that implements a defined interface and can be structured in various ways. 

This page outlines the mandatory interface requirements and suggests a structure for blocks that aligns with 
the [Workflows versioning](/workflows/versioning.md) guidelines.

## Proposed structure of plugin

We propose the following structure of plugin:

```
.
├── requirements.txt   # file with requirements
├── setup.py           # use different package creation method if you like
├── {plugin_name}
│   ├── __init__.py    # main module that contains loaders
│   ├── kinds.py       # optionally - definitions of custom kinds
│   ├── {block_name}   # package for your block
│   │   ├── v1.py      # version 1 of your block
│   │   ├── ...        # ... next versions
│   │   └── v5.py      # version 5 of your block
│   └── {block_name}   # package for another block
└── tests              # tests for blocks
```

## Required interface

Plugin must only provide few extensions to `__init__.py` in main package
compared to standard Python library:

* `load_blocks()` function to provide list of blocks' classes (required)

* `load_kinds()` function to return all custom [kinds](/workflows/kinds.md) the plugin defines (optional)

* `REGISTERED_INITIALIZERS` module property which is a dict mapping name of block 
init parameter into default value or parameter-free function constructing that value - optional 


### `load_blocks()` function

Function is supposed to enlist all blocks in the plugin - it is allowed to define 
a block once.

Example:

```python
from typing import List, Type
from inference.core.workflows.prototypes.block import WorkflowBlock

# example assumes that your plugin name is `my_plugin` and
# you defined the blocks that are imported here
from my_plugin.block_1.v1 import Block1V1
from my_plugin.block_2.v1 import Block2V1

def load_blocks() -> List[Type[WorkflowBlock]]:
    return [
        Block1V1,
        Block2V1,
]
```

### `load_kinds()` function

`load_kinds()` function to return all custom kinds the plugin defines. It is optional as your blocks
may not need custom kinds.

Example:

```python
from typing import List
from inference.core.workflows.execution_engine.entities.types import Kind

# example assumes that your plugin name is `my_plugin` and
# you defined the imported kind
from my_plugin.kinds import MY_KIND


def load_kinds() -> List[Kind]:
    return [MY_KIND]
```


## `REGISTERED_INITIALIZERS` dictionary

As you know from [the docs describing the Workflows Compiler](/workflows/workflows_compiler.md) 
and the [blocks development guide](/workflows/create_workflow_block.md), Workflow
blocs are dynamically initialized during compilation and may require constructor 
parameters. Those parameters can default to values registered in the `REGISTERED_INITIALIZERS`
dictionary. To expose default a value for an init parameter of your block - 
simply register the name of the init param and its value (or a function generating a value) in the dictionary.
This is optional part of the plugin interface, as not every block requires a constructor.

Example:

```python
import os

def init_my_param() -> str:
    # do init here
    return "some-value"

REGISTERED_INITIALIZERS = {
    "param_1": 37,
    "param_2": init_my_param,
}
```

## Serializers and deserializers for *Kinds*

Support for custom serializers and deserializers was introduced in Execution Engine `v1.3.0`.
From that version onward it is possible to point custom functions that 
Execution Engine should use to serialize and deserialize any *[kind](/workflows/kinds.md)*.

Deserializers will determine how to decode inputs send through the wire 
into internal data representation used by blocks. Serializers, on the other hand, 
are useful when Workflow results are to be send through the wire.

Below you may find example on how to add serializer and deserializer 
for arbitrary kind. The code should be placed in main `__init__.py` of
your plugin:

```python
from typing import Any

def serialize_kind(value: Any) -> Any:
  # place here the code that will be used to
  # transform internal Workflows data representation into 
  # the external one (that can be sent through the wire in JSON, using
  # default JSON encoder for Python).
  pass


def deserialize_kind(parameter_name: str, value: Any) -> Any:
  # place here the code that will be used to decode 
  # data sent through the wire into the Execution Engine
  # and transform it into proper internal Workflows data representation
  # which is understood by the blocks.
  pass


KINDS_SERIALIZERS = {
    "name_of_the_kind": serialize_kind,
}
KINDS_DESERIALIZERS = {
    "name_of_the_kind": deserialize_kind,
}
```

### Tips And Tricks

* Each serializer must be a function taking the value to serialize
and returning serialized value (accepted by default Python JSON encoder)

* Each deserializer must be a function accepting two parameters - name of 
Workflow input to be deserialized and the value to be deserialized - the goal 
of the function is to align input data with expected internal representation

* *Kinds* from `roboflow_core` plugin already have reasonable serializers and 
deserializers

* If you do not like the way how data is serialized in `roboflow_core` plugin, 
feel free to alter the serialization methods for *kinds*, simply registering
the function in your plugin and loading it to the Execution Engine - the 
serializer/deserializer defined as the last one will be in use. 


## Enabling plugin in your Workflows ecosystem

To load a plugin you must:

* install the Python package with the plugin in the environment you run Workflows

* export an environment variable named `WORKFLOWS_PLUGINS` set to a comma-separated list of names
of plugins you want to load. 
  
  * Example: to load two plugins `plugin_a` and `plugin_b`, you need to run 
  `export WORKFLOWS_PLUGINS="plugin_a,plugin_b"`
