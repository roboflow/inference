# Dynamic Python blocks

When the syntax for Workflow definitions was [outlined](/workflows/definitions.md), one key
aspect was not covered: the ability to define blocks directly within the Workflow definition itself. This section can
include the manifest and Python code for blocks defined in place, which are dynamically interpreted by the
Execution Engine. These in-place blocks function similarly to those statically defined in
[plugins](/workflows/blocks_bundling.md) yet provide much more flexibility.

## Execution Modes

Dynamic Python blocks support two execution modes:

### Local Execution
When running inference locally on your own hardware, dynamic blocks execute directly in your environment. This provides the fastest performance for development and testing.

!!! Warning

    Local execution of dynamic blocks only works in your local deployment of `inference` and requires careful consideration of security implications when running untrusted code.

    If you wish to disable the functionality, `export ALLOW_CUSTOM_PYTHON_EXECUTION_IN_WORKFLOWS=False`

### Cloud Execution (Roboflow Serverless v2)
When using Roboflow's cloud infrastructure with Serverless v2 API, dynamic blocks execute in secure, isolated containers. This ensures safe execution of custom code without compromising your infrastructure.

!!! Important "Data Serialization Requirements"

    When using cloud execution, all input and output data must be serializable through Inference's serialization system. This means:
    
    - Use simple Python types (str, int, float, bool, list, dict)
    - Numpy arrays and standard computer vision data structures are supported
    - Complex custom objects may need to be converted to simpler representations
    - Avoid returning functions, lambda expressions, or other non-serializable Python objects

The cloud execution environment provides the same standard libraries and imports as local execution, ensuring your code works consistently across both modes.

## State Management and Shared Data

Variables defined at the module level (outside of your `run` function) in your block's code are scoped to instances of that block. These variables:

- **Persist across invocations** of the same block (as long as the code doesn't change)
- **Reset when the block's code changes** any modification to the block's code creates a new namespace
- **Are lost when the server/container restarts**

**Example:**

This block increments a counter each time the block is run and remembers the last result:

```python
# This variable is block-scoped
counter = 0
last_result = None

def run(self, input_value):
    global counter, last_result
    
    counter += 1
    
    # Store the last result for comparison
    previous = last_result
    last_result = input_value * 2
    
    return {
        "run_count": counter,
        "current": last_result,
        "previous": previous
    }
```

### Best Practices for State Management

Custom Block state is meant for caching expensive computations and optimization of artifact and dependency loading.

- Do not rely on state for critical data persistence - use external storage for important data.
- State may be lost at any time due to server restarts or container scaling
- In cloud environments, subsequent requests may hit different servers with different state
- Initialize block-scoped variables with default values to handle fresh starts
- Keep state lightweight. Large objects consume memory and may impact performance.

## Theory

The high-level overview of Dynamic Python blocks functionality:

* user provides definition of dynamic block in JSON

* definition contains information required by Execution Engine to
construct `WorkflowBlockManifest` and `WorkflowBlock` out of the 
document

* At runtime, the Compiler turns the definition into dynamically created
Python classesâ€”exactly the same as statically defined blocks

* In the Workflow definition, you may declare steps that use dynamic blocks,
as if dynamic blocks were standard static ones

  
## Example 

Let's take a look and discuss example workflow with dynamic Python blocks.

    ```

Let's start the analysis from `dynamic_blocks_definitions` - this is the part of 
Workflow Definition that provides a list of dynamic blocks. Each block contains two sections:

* `manifest` - providing JSON representation of `BlockManifest` - refer [blocks development guide](/workflows/create_workflow_block.md)

* `code` - shipping Python code


### Definition of block manifest

Manifest definition contains several fields, including:

* `block_type` - equivalent of `type` field in block manifest - must provide unique block identifier

* `inputs` - dictionary with names and definitions of dynamic inputs

* `outputs` - dictionary with names and definitions of dynamic outputs

* `output_dimensionality_offset` - field specifies output dimensionality

* `accepts_batch_input` - field dictates if input data in runtime is to be provided in batches
by Execution Engine

* `accepts_empty_values` - field deciding if empty inputs will be ignored while 
constructing step inputs

In any doubt, refer to [blocks development guide](/workflows/create_workflow_block.md), as
the dynamic blocks replicates standard blocs capabilities.


### Definition of dynamic input

Dynamic inputs define fields of dynamically created block manifest. In other words, 
this is definition based on which `BlockManifest` class will be created in runtime.

Each input may define the following properties:

* `has_default_value` - flag to decide if dynamic manifest field has default

* `default_value` - default value (used only if `has_default_value=True`

* `is_optional` - flag to decide if dynamic manifest field is optional

* `is_dimensionality_reference` - flag to decide if dynamic manifest field ship
selector to be used in runtime as dimensionality reference

* `dimensionality_offset` - dimensionality offset for configured input property 
of dynamic manifest

* `selector_types` - type of selectors that may be used by property (one of 
`input_image`, `step_output_image`, `input_parameter`, `step_output`). Step may not
hold selector, but then must provide definition of specific type.

* `selector_data_kind` - dictionary with list of selector kinds specific for each selector type

* `value_types` - definition of specific type that is to be placed in manifest - 
this field specifies typing of dynamically created manifest fields w.r.t Python types.
Selection of types: `any`, `integer`, `float`, `boolean`, `dict`, `list`, `strig`

### Definition of dynamic output

Definitions of outputs are quite simple, hold optional list of `kinds` declared
for given output.


### Definition of Python code

Python code is shipped in JSON document with the following fields:

* `run_function_code` - code of `run(...)` method of your dynamic block 

* `run_function_name` - name of run function

* `init_function_code` - optional code for your init function that will 
assemble step state - it is expected to return dictionary, which will be available for `run()`
function under `self._init_results`

* `init_function_name` - name of init function

* `imports` - list of additional imports (you may only use libraries from your environment, no dependencies will be 
automatically installed)


### How to create `run(...)` method?

You must know the following:

* `run(...)` function must be defined, as if that was class instance method - with 
the first argument being `self` and remaining arguments compatible with dynamic block manifest
declared in definition of dynamic block

* you should expect baseline symbols to be provided, including your import statements and
the following:

```python
from typing import Any, List, Dict, Set, Optional
import supervision as sv
import numpy as np
import math
import time
import json
import os
import requests
import cv2
import shapely
from inference.core.workflows.execution_engine.entities.base import Batch, WorkflowImageData
from inference.core.workflows.prototypes.block import BlockResult
```

So example function may look like the following (for clarity, we provide here
Python code formatted nicely, but you must stringify the code to place it in definition):

```python
def run(self, predictions: sv.Detections, class_x: str, class_y: str) -> BlockResult:
    bboxes_class_x = predictions[predictions.data["class_name"] == class_x]
    bboxes_class_y = predictions[predictions.data["class_name"] == class_y]
    overlap = []
    for bbox_x in bboxes_class_x:
        bbox_x_coords = bbox_x[0]
        bbox_overlaps = []
        for bbox_y in bboxes_class_y:
            if bbox_y[-1]["detection_id"] == bbox_x[-1]["detection_id"]:
                continue
            bbox_y_coords = bbox_y[0]
            x_min = max(bbox_x_coords[0], bbox_y_coords[0])
            y_min = max(bbox_x_coords[1], bbox_y_coords[1])
            x_max = min(bbox_x_coords[2], bbox_y_coords[2])
            y_max = min(bbox_x_coords[3], bbox_y_coords[3])
            # compute the area of intersection rectangle
            intersection_area = max(0, x_max - x_min + 1) * max(0, y_max - y_min + 1)
            box_x_area = (bbox_x_coords[2] - bbox_x_coords[0] + 1) * (bbox_x_coords[3] - bbox_x_coords[1] + 1)
            local_overlap = intersection_area / (box_x_area + 1e-5)
            bbox_overlaps.append(local_overlap)
        overlap.append(bbox_overlaps)
    return  {"overlap": overlap}
```

### How to create `init(...)` method?

Init function is supposed to build `self._init_results` dictionary.

Example:

```python

def my_init() -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return {"some": "value"}
```

### Usage of Dynamic Python block as step

As shown in example Workflow definition, you may simply use the block 
as if that was normal block exposed through static plugin:

```json
{
    "type": "OverlapMeasurement",
    "name": "overlap_measurement",
    "predictions": "$steps.model.predictions",
    "class_x": "dog",
    "class_y": "dog"
}
```
