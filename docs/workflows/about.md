# What is Roboflow Workflows?

Roboflow Workflows is an ecosystem that enables users to create machine learning applications using a wide range 
of pluggable and reusable blocks. These blocks are organized in a way that makes it easy for users to design 
and connect different components. Graphical interface allows to visually construct workflows 
without needing extensive technical expertise. Once the workflow is designed, Workflows engine runs the 
application, ensuring all the components work together seamlessly, providing a rapid transition 
from prototype to production-ready solutions, allowing you to quickly iterate and deploy applications.  

Roboflow offers a growing selection of workflows blocks, and the community can also create new blocks, ensuring 
that the ecosystem is continuously expanding and evolving. Moreover, Roboflow provides flexible deployment options, 
including on-premises and cloud-based solutions, allowing users to deploy their applications in the environment 
that best suits their needs.

With Workflows, you can:

- Detect, classify, and segment objects in images using state-of-the-art models.

- Use Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to make determinations at any stage in a workflow.

- Introduce elements of business logic to translate model predictions into your domain language

In this section of documentation, we walk through what you need to know to create and run workflows. Letâ€™s get started!

Next, [create and run a workflow](./create_and_run.md) or
