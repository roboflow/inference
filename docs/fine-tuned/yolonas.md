## License

YOLO-NAS code is released under the **Apache 2.0** license, but the Deci-provided pre-trained weights are under a special license.

- **Training with Roboflow Train**: Commercial usage is allowed because Roboflow does not use the Deci weights.
- **Self-training outside Roboflow**: If you train your own YOLO-NAS model outside the Roboflow platform, ensuring adherence to the [Deci YOLO-NAS license](https://docs.deci.ai/super-gradients/latest/LICENSE.YOLONAS.html) is your responsibility.

See our [Licensing Guide](https://roboflow.com/licensing) for more information about how your use of YOLO-NAS is licensed when using Inference to deploy your model.
