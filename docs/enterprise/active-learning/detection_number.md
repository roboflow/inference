Choose specific detections based on count and detection classes. Collect and save images for use in improving your model.

!!! tip

    Review the [Active Learning](../active_learning) page for more information about how to use active learning.

This strategy is available for the following model types:

- `object-detection`
- `instance-segmentation`
- `keypoints-detection`

## Configuration

- `name`: user-defined name of the strategy - must be non-empty and unique within all strategies defined in a
  single configuration (required)
- `type`: with value `detections_number_based` is used to identify close to threshold sampling strategy (required)
- `selected_class_names`: list of class names to consider during sampling; if not provided, all classes can be sampled. (Optional)
- `probability`: fraction of datapoints that matches sampling criteria that will be persisted. It is meant to be float
  value in range [0.0, 1.0] (required)
- `more_than`: minimal number of detected objects - if given it is meant to be integer >= 0
  (optional - if not given - lower limit is not applied)
- `less_than`: maximum number of detected objects - if given it is meant to be integer >= 0
  (optional - if not given - upper limit is not applied)
- **NOTE:** if both `more_than` and `less_than` is not given - any number of matching detections will match the
  sampling condition
- `tags`: list of tags (each contains 1-64 characters from range `a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and -_:/.[]<>{}@`) (optional)

## Example

```json
{
  "name": "multiple_detections",
  "type": "detections_number_based",
  "probability": 0.2,
  "more_than": 3,
  "tags": ["crowded"],
  "limits": [
    { "type": "minutely", "value": 10 },
    { "type": "hourly", "value": 100 },
    { "type": "daily", "value": 1000 }
  ]
}
```
