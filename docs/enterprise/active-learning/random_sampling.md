Randomly select data to be saved for future labeling.

!!! tip

    Review the [Active Learning](../active_learning) page for more information about how to use active learning.

This strategy is available for the following model types:

- `stub`
- `classification`
- `object-detection`
- `instance-segmentation`
- `keypoints-detection`

## Configuration

- `name`: user-defined name of the strategy - must be non-empty and unique within all strategies defined in a
  single configuration (required)
- `type`: with value `random` is used to identify random sampling strategy (required)
- `traffic_percentage`: float value in range [0.0, 1.0] defining the percentage of traffic to be persisted (required)
- `tags`: list of tags (each contains 1-64 characters from range `a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and -_:/.[]<>{}@`) (optional)
- `limits`: definition of limits for data collection within a specific strategy

## Example

Here is an example of a configuration manifest for random sampling strategy:

```json
{
  "name": "my_random_sampling",
  "type": "random",
  "traffic_percentage": 0.01,
  "tags": ["my_tag_1", "my_tag_2"],
  "limits": [
    { "type": "minutely", "value": 10 },
    { "type": "hourly", "value": 100 },
    { "type": "daily", "value": 1000 }
  ]
}
```
