## Setup

Before you begin, ensure that you have Docker installed on your machine. Docker provides a containerized environment, 
allowing the Roboflow Inference Server to run in a consistent and isolated manner, regardless of the host system. If 
you haven't installed Docker yet, you can get it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## via CLI

The easiest way to run the Roboflow Inference Server with Docker is via the command line.

First, [Install the CLI](../index.md#cli).

Running the Inference Server is as simple as running the following command:

```bash
inference server start
```

This will pull the appropriate Docker image for your machine and start the Inference Server on port 9001. You can then send requests to the server to get predictions from your model, as described in [HTTP Inference](http_inference.md).

Once you have your inference server running, you can check its status with the following command:

```bash
inference server status
```

Roboflow Inference CLI currently supports the following device targets:

- x86 CPU
- ARM64 CPU
- NVIDIA GPU

For Jetson or TensorRT Runtime inference server images, pull the images directly following the [instructions below](#pull-from-docker-hub).

## Pull from Docker Hub

If you don't wish to build the Docker image locally or prefer to use the official releases, you can directly pull the 
pre-built images from the Docker Hub. These images are maintained by the Roboflow team and are optimized for various 
hardware configurations.

        ```
        docker pull roboflow/roboflow-inference-server-jetson-5.1.1
        ```

## Run

Once you have a Docker image (either built locally or pulled from Docker Hub), you can run the Roboflow Inference 
Server in a container. 

!!! example "docker run"

    === "x86 CPU"
        ```
        docker run --net=host \
        roboflow/roboflow-inference-server-cpu:latest
        ```

    === "arm64 CPU"
        ```
        docker run -p 9001:9001 \
        roboflow/roboflow-inference-server-cpu:latest
        ```

    === "GPU"
        ```
        docker run --network=host --gpus=all \
        roboflow/roboflow-inference-server-gpu:latest
        ```

    === "GPU + TensorRT"
        ```
        docker run --network=host --gpus=all \
        roboflow/roboflow-inference-server-trt:latest
        ```

    === "Jetson 4.5.x"
        ```
        docker run --privileged --net=host --runtime=nvidia \
        roboflow/roboflow-inference-server-jetson-4.5.0:latest
        ```

    === "Jetson 4.6.x"
        ```
        docker run --privileged --net=host --runtime=nvidia \
        roboflow/roboflow-inference-server-jetson-4.6.1:latest
        ```

    === "Jetson 5.x"
        ```
        docker run --privileged --net=host --runtime=nvidia \
        roboflow/roboflow-inference-server-jetson-5.1.1:latest
        ```

    **_Note:_** The Jetson images come with TensorRT dependencies. To use TensorRT acceleration with your model, pass an additional environment variable at runtime `-e ONNXRUNTIME_EXECUTION_PROVIDERS=TensorrtExecutionProvider`. This can improve inference speed, however, this also incurs a costly startup expense when the model is loaded.

You may add the flag `-e API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY>` to your `docker run` command so that you do not need to provide a Roboflow API key in your requests. Substitute `<YOUR API KEY>` with your Roboflow API key. Learn how to retrieve your [Roboflow API key here](https://docs.roboflow.com/api-reference/authentication#retrieve-an-api-key).

You may add the flag `-v $(pwd)/cache:/cache` to create a cache folder on your home device so that you do not need to redownload or recompile model artifacts upon inference container reboot. You can also (preferably) store artificats in a [docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) named `inference-cache` by adding the flag `-v inference-cache:/cache`.
