## Make Any Camera an AI Camera

Inference turns any computer or edge device into a command center for your computer vision projects.

* üõ†Ô∏è Self-host [your own fine-tuned models](https://inference.roboflow.com/quickstart/explore_models/)
* üß† Access the latest and greatest foundation models (like [Florence-2](https://blog.roboflow.com/florence-2/), [CLIP](https://blog.roboflow.com/openai-clip/), and [SAM2](https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-segment-anything-2/))
* ü§ù Use [Workflows](https://inference.roboflow.com/workflows/about/) to track, count, time, measure, and visualize
* üëÅÔ∏è Combine ML with traditional CV methods (like OCR, Barcode Reading, QR, and template matching)
* üìà Monitor, record, and analyze predictions
* üé• [Manage](https://inference.roboflow.com/workflows/video_processing/overview/) cameras and video streams
* üì¨ Send notifications when events happen
* üõú Connect with external systems and APIs
* üîó [Extend](https://inference.roboflow.com/workflows/create_workflow_block/) with your own code and models
* üöÄ Deploy production systems at scale

See [Example Workflows](https://inference.roboflow.com/workflows/gallery/) for common use-cases like detecting small objects with SAHI, multi-model consensus, active learning, reading license plates, blurring faces, background removal, and more.

[Time In Zone Workflow Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/743233d9-3460-442d-83f8-20e29e76b346)

## üî• quickstart

[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (and
[NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
for GPU acceleration if you have a CUDA-enabled GPU). Then run

```
pip install inference-cli && inference server start --dev
```

This will pull the proper image for your machine and start it in development mode.

In development mode, a Jupyter notebook server with a quickstart guide runs on 
[`localhost:9002`](http://localhost:9002). Dive in there for a whirlwind tour
of your new Inference Server's functionality!

Now you're ready to connect your camera streams and
[start building & deploying Workflows in the UI](https://app.roboflow.com/workflows)
or [interacting with your new server](https://inference.roboflow.com/workflows/create_and_run/)
via its API.

## üõ†Ô∏è build with Workflows

A key component of Inference is [Workflows](https://roboflow.com/workflows), composable blocks of common functionality that give models a common interface to make chaining and experimentation easy.

![License Plate OCR Workflow Visualization](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/178046a2-011e-489d-bfc2-41dcfefe44a4)

With Workflows, you can:
* Detect, classify, and segment objects in images using state-of-the-art models.
* Use Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to make determinations at any stage in a workflow.
* Seamlessly swap out models for a given task.
* Chain models together.
* Track, count, time, measure, and visualize objects.
* Add business logic and extend functionality to work with your external systems.

Workflows allow you to extend simple model predictions to build computer vision micro-services that fit into a larger application or fully self-contained visual agents that run on a video stream.

## üìü connecting via api
  
Once you've installed Inference, your machine is a fully-featured CV center.
You can use its API to run models and workflows on images and video streams.
By default, the server is running locally on
[`localhost:9001`](http://localhost:9001).

To interface with your server via Python, use our SDK.
`pip install inference-sdk` then run
[an example model comparison Workflow](https://app.roboflow.com/workflows/embed/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ3b3JrZmxvd0lkIjoiSHhIODdZR0FGUWhaVmtOVWNEeVUiLCJ3b3Jrc3BhY2VJZCI6IlhySm9BRVFCQkFPc2ozMmpYZ0lPIiwidXNlcklkIjoiNXcyMFZ6UU9iVFhqSmhUanE2a2FkOXVicm0zMyIsImlhdCI6MTczNTIzNDA4Mn0.AA78pZnlivFs5pBPVX9cMigFAOIIMZk0dA4gxEF5tj4)
like this:

```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient

client = InferenceHTTPClient(
    api_url="http://localhost:9001", # use local inference server
    # api_key="<YOUR API KEY>" # optional to access your private data and models
)

result = client.run_workflow(
    workspace_name="roboflow-docs",
    workflow_id="model-comparison",
    images={
        "image": "https://media.roboflow.com/workflows/examples/bleachers.jpg"
    },
    parameters={
        "model1": "yolov8n-640",
        "model2": "yolov11n-640"
    }
)

print(result)
```

In other languages, use the server's REST API;
you can access the API docs for your server at
[`/docs` (OpenAPI format)](http://localhost:9001/docs) or
[`/redoc` (Redoc Format)](http://localhost:9001/redoc).

Check out [the inference_sdk docs](https://inference.roboflow.com/inference_helpers/inference_sdk/)
to see what else you can do with your new server.

## üé• connect to video streams

The inference server is a video processing beast. You can set it up to run
Workflows on RTSP streams, webcam devices, and more. It will handle hardware
acceleration, multiprocessing, video decoding and GPU batching to get the
most out of your hardware.

[This example workflow](https://app.roboflow.com/workflows/embed/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ3b3JrZmxvd0lkIjoiNHMzSDAzcmtyU0JiSDhFMjEzZUUiLCJ3b3Jrc3BhY2VJZCI6IlhySm9BRVFCQkFPc2ozMmpYZ0lPIiwidXNlcklkIjoiNXcyMFZ6UU9iVFhqSmhUanE2a2FkOXVicm0zMyIsImlhdCI6MTczNTIzOTk3NX0.TYdmD5AS8tbpz8AxEr5xW-05LlegK61kq-5_OReIrwc?showGraph=true&hideToolbar=false)
will watch a stream for frames that
[CLIP thinks](https://blog.roboflow.com/openai-clip/) match an
inputted text prompt.
```python
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient
import atexit
import time

max_fps = 4

client = InferenceHTTPClient(
    api_url="http://localhost:9001", # use local inference server
    # api_key="<YOUR API KEY>" # optional to access your private data and models
)

# Start a stream on an rtsp stream
result = client.start_inference_pipeline_with_workflow(
    video_reference=["rtsp://user:password@192.168.0.100:554/"],
    workspace_name="roboflow-docs",
    workflow_id="clip-frames",
    max_fps=max_fps,
    workflows_parameters={
        "prompt": "blurry", # change to look for something else
        "threshold": 0.16
    }
)

pipeline_id = result["context"]["pipeline_id"]

# Terminate the pipeline when the script exits
atexit.register(lambda: client.terminate_inference_pipeline(pipeline_id))

while True:
  result = client.consume_inference_pipeline_result(pipeline_id=pipeline_id)

  if not result["outputs"] or not result["outputs"][0]:
    # still initializing
    continue

  output = result["outputs"][0]
  is_match = output.get("is_match")
  similarity = round(output.get("similarity")*100, 1)
  print(f"Matches prompt? {is_match} (similarity: {similarity}%)")

  time.sleep(1/max_fps)
```

Pipeline outputs can be consumed via API for downstream processing or the
Workflow can be configured to call external services with Notification blocks
(like [Email](https://inference.roboflow.com/workflows/blocks/email_notification/)
or [Twilio](https://inference.roboflow.com/workflows/blocks/twilio_sms_notification/))
or the [Webhook block](https://inference.roboflow.com/workflows/blocks/webhook_sink/).
For more info on video pipeline management, see the
[Video Processing overview](https://inference.roboflow.com/workflows/video_processing/overview/).

If you have a Roboflow account & have linked an API key, you can also remotely
[monitor and manage your running streams](https://app.roboflow.com/devices)
via the Roboflow UI.

## üîë connect to the cloud

Without an API Key, you can access a wide range of pre-trained and foundational models and run public Workflows.

Pass an optional [Roboflow API Key](https://app.roboflow.com/settings/api) to the `inference_sdk` or API to access additional features enhanced by Roboflow's Cloud
platform. When running with an API Key, usage is metered according to
Roboflow's [pricing tiers](https://roboflow.com/pricing).

## üå©Ô∏è hosted compute

If you don't want to manage your own infrastructure for self-hosting, Roboflow offers a hosted Inference Server via [one-click Dedicated Deployments](https://docs.roboflow.com/deploy/dedicated-deployments) (CPU and GPU machines) billed hourly, or simple models and Workflows via our [serverless Hosted API](https://docs.roboflow.com/deploy/hosted-api) billed per API-call.

We offer a [generous free-tier](https://roboflow.com/pricing) to get started.

## üñ•Ô∏è run on-prem or self-hosted

Inference is designed to run on a wide range of hardware from beefy cloud servers to tiny edge devices. This lets you easily develop against your local machine or our cloud infrastructure and then seamlessly switch to another device for production deployment.

`inference server start` attempts to automatically choose the optimal container to optimize performance on your machine (including with GPU acceleration via NVIDIA CUDA when available). Special installation notes and performance tips by device are listed below:

* [Linux](https://inference.roboflow.com/install/linux/)
* [Windows](https://inference.roboflow.com/install/windows/)
* [Mac](https://inference.roboflow.com/install/mac/)
* [NVIDIA Jetson](https://inference.roboflow.com/install/jetson/)
