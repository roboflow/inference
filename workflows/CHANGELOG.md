# Changelog

This is the canonical changelog for the `roboflow-workflows` package, including
blocks, dependencies, and execution-engine behavior. Add engine behavior changes
under `## Unreleased` → `### Execution engine`; one entry is sufficient.

Package releases record their bundled execution-engine compatibility version,
which can remain unchanged across package releases. The package version and
engine version are separate; workflow and block compatibility use the engine
version. The mapping starts with package `0.2.2` below.

Earlier engine changes and migration guidance remain in the
[historical execution-engine changelog](https://docs.roboflow.com/workflows/developer-guide/developer-guide/execution-engine-changelog).
See the [engine release rule](../.cursor/rules/execution-engine-version-changelog.mdc)
for contributor and maintainer responsibilities.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- MQTT Writer: a broker that refuses the connection (bad user name or password, not authorised, unacceptable protocol version) is now reported in the outputs with the broker's reason, and the client stops reconnecting instead of retrying the same credentials about once a second, which tripped brokers' authentication rate limiting. The refusal is reported as soon as the broker answers rather than after `timeout`, and every later run repeats it without touching the broker; fix the configuration and restart the pipeline. A broker answering "unavailable" keeps retrying in the background.
- MQTT Reader: declares its workload - external requests and messages buffered between runs, no dependent models or projects - and gives its two restrictions stable codes (`unavailable_on_hosted_platform`, `connection_and_state_rebuilt_per_request`) in both the editor and the actual declaration. Runtime behaviour and the editor payload are unchanged.

### Added

- MQTT Reader enterprise block (`roboflow_enterprise/mqtt_reader@v1`): subscribes to an MQTT topic and returns one message per run as raw text and parsed JSON, with `read_mode` selecting the newest message (`latest`) or the next unread one (`sequential`). Retained messages are returned on the first run; the subscription is restored after a reconnect, and a 15 s keepalive reports a silently lost broker within about 25 s. Live subscriptions need an `InferencePipeline`; over the HTTP API each request only sees retained messages. A broker that refuses the connection (bad user name or password, not authorised, rejected client id) is reported with the broker's reason as soon as it answers, and the client stops reconnecting; a broker answering "unavailable" keeps retrying. After the first subscription a run never waits for the broker: while the connection is down, runs return the last message with `error_status` set instead of an empty message, buffered messages first; the outage is logged once at its start and once at recovery.
- Persistent sessions for the MQTT Reader: an optional `client_id` (unique per broker, for example the pipeline name from a workflow input) connects with that id and a non-clean session, so the broker keeps the subscription and queues QoS 1/2 messages while the block is away and delivers the backlog when the same id reconnects, after a pipeline or process restart included. Requires `qos` 1 or 2 (a run with `client_id` and `qos` 0 reports an error); the publisher must also publish at QoS 1 or higher. Meant for `InferencePipeline`s; `sequential` works through the backlog one message per run. Left empty, the behaviour is unchanged.
- TLS for the MQTT Reader and MQTT Writer: an `encryption` dropdown (`none`, default, or `tls`) encrypts the connection and verifies the broker's certificate against the system trust store; `ca_certificate_path` (shown for TLS only) points at a PEM bundle for a private CA and requires `ALLOW_WORKFLOW_BLOCKS_ACCESSING_LOCAL_STORAGE=True`. The port is not switched automatically and verification cannot be disabled.
- Operator policy for the MQTT Reader and MQTT Writer broker address: `MQTT_WORKFLOWS_BLOCKS_WHITELISTED_HOSTS` (comma-separated `host[:port]` allowlist, no DNS) and `MQTT_WORKFLOWS_BLOCKS_ALLOW_USER_PROVIDED_HOST` (default `True`; when `False` the workflow's host and port are ignored and the first allowlist entry is used). Defaults preserve existing behaviour.

### Execution Engine Change

- Add compile-time workload introspection with graph structure, dimensionality, model usage, resources and conditional restrictions. Each entity `type` carries its contract version (e.g. `workflow_introspection_v1`); there is no separate `schema_version`.
- Report unresolved resource identities explicitly and include streaming-video models without changing how they load.
- Align static and actual restriction codes, and correct stateful-block and industrial-sink caveats without changing editor payloads.
- Reject cyclic saved inner-workflow references during resolution with a composition
  error instead of `RecursionError`. Enforce nesting depth and total inner-workflow
  count limits during reference expansion, before fetching or expanding children
  beyond those limits. Valid repeated references and remote dispatch are unchanged;
  no migration is required.

## `0.2.2`

Bundled execution engine: `1.15.2`.

### Added
- OpenAI block (`open_ai@v7`): `gpt-6-sol` and `gpt-6-luna` model options.
- Anthropic Claude block (`anthropic_claude@v5`): `claude-opus-5-5` model option.

---

## `0.2.1`

### Fixed

- Expose native Qwen 3.8 VL 27B in Qwen VLM blocks v2–v4, including model discovery and thinking support.
- SpaceXAI object detection encodes PNG at compression level 9. OpenCV's default compression put large frames over xAI's 25MB upload limit.

### Added

- SpaceXAI block (`spacexai@v3`): `grok-4.7` model option with `low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh` reasoning effort. Detection reuses the Grok 4.5/4.6 prompt.

---

## `0.2.0`

### Added

- Python 3.13 support (`requires-python` is now `>=3.10,<3.14`).
- OpenAI v7 detection and instance-segmentation accept optional `output_classes`, keeping visual
  prompts in `classes` while constraining and decoding model output with stable labels.
---

## `0.1.2`

### Fixed

- Webhook sink: SSRF hardening (destination validation, DNS pinning, redirect and proxy refusal) now applies only when `ALLOW_WEBHOOK_WORKFLOWS_SINK_TO_NON_GLOBAL_ADDRESSES=false`. The default restores the previous plain `requests` transport, so environment `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` work again.

---

## `0.1.1`

### Fixed

- Accept Python string class names from NumPy object arrays in detection-property expressions, avoiding `.item()` errors after custom Python blocks.

### Added

- Kafka Consumer and Kafka Producer enterprise blocks; `confluent-kafka` and `aws-msk-iam-sasl-signer-python` join the `enterprise` extra.

### Changed

- Dropped unused dependencies: `opencv-contrib-python`, `requests-toolbelt`, and test extras `pytest-asyncio`, `pytest-timeout`, `aioresponses`.

---

## `0.1.0`

- Initial release: Workflows execution engine and block library extracted from `inference`.
